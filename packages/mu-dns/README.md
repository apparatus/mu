## Install

```sh
$ npm install mu-dns
```

##Â Purpose
The mu-dns adapter performs DNS lookups either directly against a nominated DNS server or using the system resolver mechanism. It is intended for use in container based deployments for example with Kubernetes or with the `fuge` development tool.

## Operation

### Lookup sequence
Mu-dns resolves services as follows:

* Perform an SRV query to determine service port number and canonical name
* Then perform an A query against the canonical name to determine one or more ip addresses

### mode
Mu-dns operates in one of two modes, direct or system depending on the environment configuration.

* if `DNS_HOST` variable is present in the environment then a direct lookup is performed in this case
  * Use `DNS_HOST` and `DNS_PORT` to connect directly to a DNS server. If `DNS_PORT` is not set default to 53053 as the port number
* if `DNS_HOST` is not present then use the system based resolver for queries

### Query formation
Mu-dns forms SRV queries as follows:

```
_<port name>._<protocol name>.<service name>.<namespace>.<suffix>
```

The query is constructed as follows:

* `<port name>` must be supplied
* `<protocol name>` may be supplied, defaults to '_tcp'
* `<service name>` must be supplied
* `<namespace>` may be supplied, otherwise the `DNS_NAMESPACE` variable is used if supplied, otherwise defaults to 'default'
* `<suffix>` may be supplied, otherwise the `DNS_SUFFIX` variable is used if supplied, otherwise defaults to 'svc.cluster.local'


## Examples

```javascript
var mu = require('mu')()
var tcp = require('mu-tcp')
var dns = require('mu-dns')

mu.outbound({role: 'basic'}, dns(tcp, {name: 'my_service', portName: '_main'}))
```

In the above example service name and portName are supplied, this will result in SRV query: '_main._tcp.my_service.default.svc.cluster.local'
